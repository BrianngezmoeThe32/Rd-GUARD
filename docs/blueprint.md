# **App Name**: RoadGuard

## Core Features:

- Emergency Request Submission: Users can submit emergency requests, including their location, vehicle information, and the type of assistance needed (fuel, mechanical, etc.)
- Verified Assistant Matching: Match users with verified assistants based on location and service request. Since assistants may vary in the services they provide, the app will use a tool that evaluates service history when selecting an assistant, to try to improve the chance of a successful match.
- Real-Time Tracking: Provide real-time tracking of the assistant's location as they travel to the user.
- Communication Channel: Enable direct communication between the user and the assistant within the app (text and voice).
- Service Completion Confirmation: Users confirm successful completion of service and can rate/review the assistant.
- SOS Functionality: A prominent SOS button for immediate connection to emergency services.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Safety Orange (#FF6600) to convey urgency and visibility, inspired by construction and emergency services. This saturated color commands immediate attention, critical for an app focused on roadside assistance. Orange is friendly but demanding, professional but never cold.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F2F2F2), providing a clean and neutral backdrop that ensures readability and highlights key interface elements. It also has some of the saturation of the primary color.
- Accent color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF), complementing the Safety Orange while drawing attention to interactive elements and calls to action.  The lightness contrasts well with the background to communicate interactivity.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif. Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif. These pairings provide a clean, contemporary look suitable for an app focused on transportation services.
- Use clear, easily recognizable icons for service types (fuel, repair, towing) and navigation elements.
- Prioritize clear and concise information layout with prominent call-to-action buttons. Keep essential functions easily accessible.
- Subtle transitions and animations to confirm actions and guide the user through the request process. Keep animations minimal to avoid distracting from the app's primary function.
